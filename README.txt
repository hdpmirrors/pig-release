Apache Pig
===========
Pig is a dataflow programming environment for processing very large files. Pig's
language is called Pig Latin. A Pig Latin program consists of a directed
acyclic graph where each node represents an operation that transforms data.
Operations are of two flavors: (1) relational-algebra style operations such as
join, filter, project; (2) functional-programming style operators such as map,
reduce. 

Pig compiles these dataflow programs into (sequences of) map-reduce or Apache Tez
jobs and executes them using Hadoop. It is also possible to execute Pig Latin
programs in a "local" mode (without Hadoop cluster), in which case all 
processing takes place in a single local JVM.
